# my stinky website
i absolutely hate markdown

## here you can contemplate the worst websites i have copied

- [azur lane sorter (last update dec 2019)](https://kidajiwo.github.io/azurlanesorter/index.html)
- [blue archive sorter (last update mar 2022)](https://kidajiwo.github.io/bluearchivesorter/index.html)
